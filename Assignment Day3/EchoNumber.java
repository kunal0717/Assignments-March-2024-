// Question No. 11 :-

class EchoNumber{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		int i = 5;
		while(i!=0){
			System.out.println(i);
			
		
		}
		
		

}


}

/* I think it will not be possible with the for loop because in for we have to initialiaze the i variable with some value and it can then only incremented or decremented but the question says that until user enters so there for loop will fail I guess.*/
